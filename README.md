Beginning stages of my blog site.

You can create an account, login, and upload a profile picture after you verify your account. 
The passwords are hashed, so database admins can't see that sensitive information.
In addition, the verification email will be in your spam box and say the content might be malicious. 
I developed this project so I know it's not.

Here is how to get this to work.
1. git clone https://github.com/Otnzfq-Fleqf/Sprint1

Navigate to the root of the project directly and enter:
2. "npm install"
3. run "node app.js"

4. now go to "http://localhost:3000" in your url bar
